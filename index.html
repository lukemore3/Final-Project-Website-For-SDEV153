        <p>Basketball is a popular team sport played globally, involving two teams of five players each competing on a rectangular court. The objective is to score points by shooting the ball into the opponent's basket while defending one's own basket. Each hoop is typically 10 feet in the air and 10 inches in diameter.</p>

      <p>In basketball, teams use a leather and/or plastic ball that is around 29.5 inches in circumference. Players use that ball to do things such as dribbling, passing, and executing plays to create scoring opportunities. That is just one side of the sport though, as when teams are not on offense, they run back in transition and play defense. This is where they have to attempt to prohibit the opposite team from scoring on their own basket. </p>

        <p>The sport follows a set of rules that govern gameplay, including ball handling, scoring, fouls, and violations. Teams strive to outscore their opponents through field goals, free throws, and three-pointers. The game requires a mix of physical attributes like agility, coordination, speed, and strength, along with teamwork and good decision-making skills.</p>

        <p>Beyond competition, Basketball entertains a huge and diverse community, breaking down barriers of age, gender, and culture. It promotes sportsmanship and personal health and growth.</p>
